                    <p class="sub-name">EMERGING TECHNOLOGY <br> PRODUCT & DESIGN LEADERSHIP</p>
                    <p>I lead organizations in creating the next generation of technology. My work spans ecosystems – AI/ML, XR, robotics, the future of the internet, new hardware, and more.</p>
                    <p>As Managing Director of IDEO's Emerging Technology Lab, I guide teams in developing breakthrough products and strategic futures for global clients like Google, Microsoft, and Sony. My past work includes pioneering emotion AI for mental health with Dr. John Gottman and co-founding Moringa School, a chain of tech education schools in Africa. I began my career as a software engineer.</p>
                    <p>I’ve spoken at places like SxSW, Fast Company Innovation Festival, the MIT Media Lab, and Harvard. I’ve delivered international keynotes, created interactive emerging technology museums, and published numerous articles.</p>
                    <p>My work has been recognized by MIT, Forbes, and the World Economic Forum. I advise and invest in startups, and I sit on the board of Duke’s Design & Technology Innovation Master’s program.</p>
                    <p>Most importantly, I have a habit of uncontrollably cry-laughing at incredibly mundane things. </p>

                    <p class="sub-name">EMERGING TECHNOLOGY <br> UX LEADERSHIP</p>
                    <p>I design how people will interact with the next generation of technology. My work spans ecosystems – AI/ML, XR, robotics, the future of the internet, new hardware, and more.</p>
                    <p>As Managing Director of IDEO’s Emerging Technology Lab, I guide teams in developing breakthrough products and strategic futures for our global network of clients. I work across our full portfolio, but specialize in collaborating with large tech and electronics companies. My past work includes working with Dr. John Gottman to serve millions of people using emotion AI for mental health, and co-founding Moringa School, a chain of tech education schools in Africa that have graduated over 20k people. I began my career as a software engineer.</p>
                    <p>I’ve spoken at places like SxSW, Fast Company Innovation Festival, the MIT Media Lab, and Harvard. I’ve delivered international keynotes, created interactive emerging technology museums, and published numerous articles. My work has been recognized by MIT, Forbes, and the World Economic Forum.</p>
                    <p>Most importantly, I have a habit of uncontrollably cry-laughing at incredibly mundane things. </p>
